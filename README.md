A chatbot built with Rasa NLU and Node.js primarily to understand the usage of Rasa NLU to do intent and entity classification. 

Node.js and Socket.io were used to create a thin wrapper over Rasa and provide apis to communicate with the chatbot. 

Note: The Rasa NLU model must be trained manually before conversing with the Chatbot.
